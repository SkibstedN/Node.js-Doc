        <h1>Node Package Manager</h1>
        <p>Npm is a package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It provides a way for 
        developers to share and reuse code in the form of packages or modules. With npm, you can easily 
        manage dependencies, install, update, and remove packages for your projects. 
        It is an essential tool for JavaScript developers and is widely used in web development.</p>

        <p>The npm ecosystem consists of three main components:</p>
        
        <p>1. npm CLI (Command Line Interface): The npm command-line tool allows you to interact with the npm registry, 
                manage packages, and run scripts. You can install, uninstall, and update packages or manage your project's 
                dependencies using simple commands.</p>
        
        <p>2. npm Registry: The npm registry is a vast online repository that hosts thousands of open-source JavaScript packages. 
                Developers can publish their packages to the registry, making them accessible to other developers around the world.</p>
        
        <p>3. package.json: This is a manifest file for your project that lists its dependencies, metadata, and configuration 
                information. When you use npm to manage your project's dependencies, the package.json file keeps track of the 
                required packages and their specific versions.</p>
        
        <p>To get started with npm, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system. Node.js comes bundled with npm, 
                so when you install Node.js, you'll automatically have access to the npm command-line tool. 
                </p>
        
        <p>Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can create a new project using the command:</p>
        
        <p>npm init</p>
        
        <p>This will guide you through creating a package.json file for your project. You can then start installing packages 
                using the npm install command, like so:</p>
        
        <p>npm install <package-name></p>
