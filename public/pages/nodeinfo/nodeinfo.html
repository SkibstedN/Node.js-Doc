            <h1>Node.js info</h1>
<p>Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that enables developers to build high-performance applications using JavaScript. It is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and allows developers to use JavaScript on both the front-end and back-end of their applications. Node.js is known for its scalability and is often used for building web applications, APIs, real-time applications, and command-line tools.</p>
<h2>Why Node.js?</h2>
<p>Node.js uses asynchronous programming!</p>
<p>Here is how Node.js handles a file request:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Sends the task to the computer's file system.</li>
    <li>Ready to handle the next request.</li>
    <li>When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.</li>
</ol>
<p>Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request. Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of Node.js is its ability to handle large numbers of concurrent connections with low overhead. This makes it well-suited for building real-time web applications, such as chat applications or online multiplayer games.</p>
<h2>What Can Node.js Do?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Node.js can generate dynamic page content.</li>
    <li>Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server.</li>
    <li>Node.js can collect form data.</li>
    <li>Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to install Node.js?</h2>
<p>To install Node.js, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to the Node.js website at https://nodejs.org/en/download/.</li>
    <li>Download the version of Node.js that is appropriate for your operating system. Node.js supports a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.</li>
    <li>Run the installer and follow the instructions provided. The installation process will vary depending on your operating system.</li>
    <li>Once the installation is complete, open a terminal or command prompt and type <code>node -v</code> to check the version of Node.js that was installed. If everything is working properly, you should see the version number printed to the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! You now have Node.js installed on your system and can start using it to build web applications.</p>
<h2>Starting a Node.js Project in Visual Studio Code</h2>
<p>Starting a Node.js project in Visual Studio Code involves several steps, including creating a new project directory, initializing a new Node.js project, and configuring Visual Studio Code to work with the project. Here are the basic steps of a way to do it:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.</li><br>
    <li>Use the <code>mkdir</code> command to create a new directory for your project, for example:<br>
        <pre><code>   mkdir my-node-project</code></pre></li>
    <li>Initialize a new Node.js project: In the terminal window, navigate to the new project directory and use the  <br> <pre><code>   npm init</code></pre> command to initialize a new Node.js project.<br><br>
        </li><li>Use the <code>npm install</code> command to install any dependencies your project requires, for example: <br>
        <pre><code>   npm install express</code></pre></li>
    <li>Create a new file: In Visual Studio Code, create a new file in the project directory by selecting <em>File &gt; New File</em> from the menu or using the keyboard shortcut <code>Ctrl+N</code>. Save the file with a <code>.js</code> extension, for example, <code>app.js</code>.</li><br>
    <li>In the new file, write Node.js code, for example:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>
            const express = require('express');
            const app = express();

            app.get('/', (req, res) => {
            res.send('Hello, world!');
            });

            app.listen(3000, () => {
            console.log('Server started on port 3000');
            });
</code></pre>
<p>This is a simple Node.js web server built using the Express.js framework that listens for HTTP requests on port 3000 and responds with the message "Hello, world!" when the root URL is accessed. Express will be explained in another document.</p>
<p>In the terminal window, use the <code>node</code> command to run your Node.js application, for example:<br>
    <pre><code>      node app.js</code></pre></p>
<p>We have, however, installed the great <code>nodeman</code> tool to assist us in the development process so we will run the app with nodemon like this:</p>
<pre><code>     Nodemon.cmd app.js</code></pre>
<p>Nodemon will attempt to restart the app everytime a change in the sourcecode is made. Nodemon will be further explained in another document.</p>
<p>The Node.js application should now be running, and can be viewed it in a web browser by navigating to <a href="http://localhost:3000/">http://localhost:3000/</a>.</p>
