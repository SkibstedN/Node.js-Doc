            <h1>Node.js info</h1>
            <p><b>Node.js</b> is a powerful runtime environment that enables developers to
                 build high-performance applications using JavaScript. It is based 
                 on the V8 JavaScript engine and allows developers to use JavaScript 
                 on both the front-end and back-end of their applications. 
                 Node.js is known for its scalability and is often used for building 
                 web applications, APIs, real-time applications, and command-line tools.<br><br>

                <b>Why Node.js?</b><br>
                Node.js uses asynchronous programming!<br>
                <b></b>Here is how Node.js handles a file request:</b><br>
                1. Sends the task to the computer's file system.<br>
                2. Ready to handle the next request.<br>
                3. When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.<br><br>
                Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.<br>
                Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, which is very memory efficient.<br><br>
        
                One of the key benefits of Node.js is its ability to handle large numbers of concurrent connections with low overhead. 
                This makes it well-suited for building real-time web applications, such as chat applications or online multiplayer games.<br><br>
                
                <b>What Can Node.js Do?</b><br>
                Node.js can generate dynamic page content.<br>
                Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server.<br>
                Node.js can collect form data.<br>
                Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database.<br>
