            <h1>Node.js info.</h1>
            <p>
                <p><b>Node.js</b> is a powerful runtime environment that enables developers to build 
                 high-performance applications using JavaScript. It is based on the V8 
                 JavaScript engine and allows developers to use JavaScript on both the 
                 front-end and back-end of their applications. Node.js is known for its 
                 scalability and is often used for building web applications, APIs, real-time 
                 applications, and command-line tools.<br></p>
                
                <p><b>Why Node.js?</b><br>
                Node.js uses asynchronous programming!
                Here is how Node.js handles a file request:<br>
                1. Sends the task to the computer's file system.<br>
                2. Ready to handle the next request.<br>
                3. When the file system has opened and read the file, <br>
                the server returns the content to the client.<br></p>
                
                <p>Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.
                Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous programming, 
                which is very memory efficient.<br></p>
                
                <p>One of the key benefits of Node.js is its ability to handle large numbers 
                of concurrent connections with low overhead. This makes it well-suited for 
                building real-time web applications, such as chat applications or online multiplayer games.<br>
                </p>
                <p><b>What Can Node.js Do?</b><br>
                Node.js can generate dynamic page content.<br>
                Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server.<br>
                Node.js can collect form data.<br>
                Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database.<br></p>
                
                <p><b>How?</b><br>
                To install Node.js, follow these steps:<br>
                1.	Go to the Node.js website at https://nodejs.org/en/download/.<br>
                2.	Download the version of Node.js that is appropriate for your operating system. 
                Node.js supports a variety of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.<br>
                3.	Run the installer and follow the instructions provided. The installation process 
                will vary depending on your operating system.<br>
                4.	Once the installation is complete, open a terminal or command prompt and type 
                node -v 
                to check the version of Node.js that was installed. If everything is working properly, 
                you should see the version number printed to the screen.<br></p>
                
                <p>That's it! You now have Node.js installed on your system and can start using it to build 
                web applications.</p>
                
                <p>In the context of our pensum we have been running Node.js in Visual Studio Code.
                Starting a Node.js project in Visual Studio Code involves several steps, including creating 
                a new project directory, initializing a new Node.js project, and configuring Visual Studio 
                Code to work with the project. Here are the basic steps of a way to do it:<br>
                Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.
                Use the mkdir command to create a new directory for your project, for example:
                <p class="cmd">$ mkdir my-node-project</p>
                Initialize a new Node.js project: In the terminal window, navigate to the new project directory 
                and use the npm init command to initialize a new Node.js project. 
                <p class="cmd">$ cd my-node-project npm init</p>
                
                This command will create a package.json file, which is used to define the metadata of the project, 
                including its name, version, description, dependencies, scripts, and other important information. 
                The file is also used by npm to manage the project's dependencies and allow other developers to 
                install and use the project.</p>
                
                <p>Use the npm install command to install any dependencies your project requires, for example:
                    <p class="cmd"> $ npm install express</p>
                </p>
                
                <p><b>Create a new file:</b> <br>In Visual Studio Code, create a new file in the project 
                directory by selecting File > New File from the menu or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+N. <br>
                Save the file with a .js extension, for example, app.js.<br>
                In the new file, write Node.js code, for example:<br></p>
                
                <pre>
                <code class="language-javascript">
                const express = require('express');
                const app = express();
                
                app.get('/', (req, res) => { 
                            res.send('Hello, world!');
                });
                
                app.listen(3000, () => { 
                    console.log('Server started on port 3000'); 
                });
                </code>
                </pre>
                
                <p>This is a simple Node.js web server built using the Express.js framework that listens 
                for HTTP requests on port 3000 and responds with the message "Hello, world!" when the 
                root URL is accessed. Express will be explained in another document.<br><br>
                
                In the terminal window, use the node command to run your Node.js application. example:   
                <p class="cmd">
                 $ node app.js
                </p>
                
                We have, however, installed the great nodemon tool to assist us in the development process 
                so we will run the app with nodemon like this:
                <p class="cmd">
                $ nodemon.cmd app.js
                </p>
                
                Nodemon will attempt to restart the app everytime a change in the sourcecode is made. <br>
                Nodemon will be further explained in another document.<br><br>
                
                The Node.js application should now be running, and can be viewed it in a web browser 
                by navigating to http://localhost:3000/ .
                </p>
                
            </p>
            </div>
