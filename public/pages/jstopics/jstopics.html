        <p><b>ECMAscript and ES6.</b><br>
        ECMAScript (or ES) is a scripting language specification standardized by the Ecma International 
        organization. It was first introduced in 1997 and has been updated several times since then, 
        with the latest version being ES2022.<br>
        ECMAScript provides the core features and functionality for many popular programming languages 
        such as JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript. It defines the syntax, data types, control 
        structures, and objects for these languages, which are used to create dynamic web applications, 
        web pages, and mobile apps.<br>
        The ECMAScript specification defines a set of rules that a language must follow to be considered 
        a conforming implementation of the standard. These rules are designed to ensure that ECMAScript 
        is consistent and compatible across different platforms and environments.<br>
        Some of the key features of ECMAScript include variables, functions, arrays, objects, loops, 
        conditional statements, and error handling. It also includes more advanced features such as 
        classes, modules, arrow functions, generators, and promises.<br>
        JavaScript, which is the most popular client-side scripting language used in web development, 
        is based on the ECMAScript specification. Therefore, developers who work with JavaScript are 
        essentially working with ECMAScript, and are often referred to as ECMAScript developers.<br><br>

        <b>ES6.</b>    <br>
        ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a major update to the ECMAScript language specification 
        that was released in June 2015. It introduced significant new features and improvements to the 
        language, including:<br>
        &bull; Arrow functions<br>
        &bull; Classes<br>
        &bull; Modules<br>
        &bull; Promises<br>
        &bull; Template literals<br>
        &bull; Destructuring<br>
        &bull; Default function parameters<br>
        &bull; Rest and spread operators<br>
        ES6 was a major update that brought many improvements to JavaScript and made it a more powerful 
        and flexible language. It has been widely adopted by web developers and is supported by all modern 
        browsers. Many developers now use ES6 as the baseline for their JavaScript projects and rely on 
        transpilers like Babel to ensure compatibility with older browsers.<br>

        Primitive datatypes: are not objects and do not have methods. They include : Number, String, 
        Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol.<br>
        Complex datatypes: these are objects that can hold multiple values and have methods.<br>
        They include : Object, Array, Function, Date, RegEx.</p>
        
        <p>In addition to these are two special values: NaN (not a number) and Infinity.</p>
        
        <p>Scoping: var, let , const &ndash; types of variables.<br>
        var is still supported but let and const is recommended.<br>
        const must be initialized at the time of declaration and can not be re-assigned once initialized.<br>
        let: accessible only within the block it is declared, including nested blocks - can be re-assigned 
        but can not be re-dclared within the same scope.</p>
        
        <p>Functions:<br>
        Strings:<br>
        number() convert a string, boolean, or object value to a number. <br>
        const myString = &quot;123&quot;;<br>
        const myNumber = Number(myString); <br>
        In this example, the Number() method is used to convert the string &quot;123&quot; to a number. 
        The resulting number is assigned to the myNumber variable.</p>
        
        <p>parseFloat() converts float values in a string to a float number that can be logged.<br>
        const myString = &quot;3.14&quot;;<br>
        const myNumber = parseFloat(myString);<br>
        In this example, the parseFloat() method is used to convert the string &quot;3.14&quot; to a 
        floating-point number. The resulting number is assigned to the myNumber variable.</p>
        
        <p>toFixed() format a number as a string with a specified number of decimal places.<br>
        The result of the function is always a string, not a number. If you need to perform arithmetic 
        operations on the result, you will need to convert the string back to a number using the Number() 
        function or parseFloat() method.<br>
        const myNumber = 3.14159;<br>
        const formattedNumber = myNumber.toFixed(2);<br>
        In this example, the toFixed() method is used to format the number 3.14159 with 2 decimal places. 
        The resulting string &quot;3.14&quot; is assigned to the formattedNumber variable.</p>
        
        <p> Replace() search a string for a specified value or a regular expression, and replace the matching 
                values with a new value. <br>
        const myString = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;<br>
        const newString = myString.replace(&quot;world&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;);<br>
        In this example, the replace() method is used to replace the substring &quot;world&quot; in the 
        string &quot;Hello, world!&quot; with &quot;JavaScript&quot;. The resulting string &quot;Hello, 
        JavaScript!&quot; is assigned to the newString variable.</p>
        
       <p>
        Arrays:<br>
        push() add elements to the end of an array.<br>
        const myArray = [1, 2, 3];<br>
        myArray.push(4);<br>
        In this example, the push() method is used to add the element 4 to the end of the myArray array. 
        The resulting array [1, 2, 3, 4] is assigned back to myArray.</p>
        
        <p>indexOf() search an array for an element and return its index position. If the element is not 
                found in the array, the method returns -1.<br>
        const myArray = [&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;];<br>
        const index = myArray.indexOf(&quot;banana&quot;);<br>
        In this example, the indexOf() method is used to find the index of the &quot;banana&quot; element 
        in the myArray array. The resulting index 1 is assigned to the index variable.</p>
        
        <p>splice() add and/or remove elements from an array.<br>
        const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];<br>
        myArray.splice(1, 2, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;);<br>
        In this example, the splice() method is used to remove two elements starting from the index 1 in 
        the myArray array, and then add two new elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; at the same position. 
        The resulting array [1, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, 4] is assigned back to myArray.</p>
        
        <p>slice() copy an array or elements of an array into a new array.&rsquo;<br>
        const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];<br>
        const newArray = myArray.slice(1, 3);<br>
        In this example, the slice() method is used to extract elements starting from index 1 up to, but not 
        including, index 3 in the myArray array. The resulting array [2, 3] is assigned to the newArray variable. 
        Note that the original array myArray remains unchanged.</p>
        
        <p>pop() remove the last element from an array and return that element.<br>
        const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];<br>
        const lastElement = myArray.pop();<br>
        In this example, the pop() method is used to remove the last element (4) from the myArray array and 
        return it. The resulting array [1, 2, 3] is assigned back to myArray, and the returned element 4 is 
        assigned to the lastElement variable.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>Callback functions: <br>
        Callbacks are used to handle the results of asynchronous operations in a non-blocking manner. 
        The callback function is passed as an argument to another function and is called by that function 
        at some point during its execution.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>
        Date () object. <br>
        In JavaScript, the Date object is a built-in object that represents a single moment in time. 
        It can be used to work with dates and times in various ways, such as creating, formatting, and 
        manipulating dates.<br>
        When you create a Date object using the new Date() constructor, it will be initialized with the 
        current date and time. You can also create a Date object for a specific date and time by passing 
        arguments to the constructor.</p>
        
        <p>Here are some common methods and properties of the Date object:<br>
        &bull; getFullYear(): returns the year of the date as a four-digit number<br>
        &bull; getMonth(): returns the month of the date as a zero-based 
        number (0 = January, 1 = February, etc.)<br>
        &bull; getDate(): returns the day of the month of the date as a number (1-31)<br>
        &bull; getDay(): returns the day of the week of the date as a zero-based 
        number (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.)<br>
        &bull; getHours(): returns the hour of the date as a number (0-23)<br>
        &bull; getMinutes(): returns the minute of the date as a number (0-59)<br>
        &bull; getSeconds(): returns the second of the date as a number (0-59)<br>
        &bull; getTime(): returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC 
        (also known as Unix timestamp)<br>
        &bull; setFullYear(): sets the year of the date<br>
        &bull; setMonth(): sets the month of the date (zero-based)<br>
        &bull; setDate(): sets the day of the month of the date<br>
        &bull; setHours(): sets the hour of the date<br>
        &bull; setMinutes(): sets the minute of the date<br>
        &bull; setSeconds(): sets the second of the date<br>
        &bull; toString(): returns a string representing the date and time</p>
        
        <p>There are many other methods and properties available on the Date object, 
                and it is a powerful tool for working with dates and times in JavaScript.</p>
        
        <p>Here's an example of creating a new Date object and getting the current date and time:</p>
        
        <p>const currentDate = new Date().toLocaleString();</p>
        
        <p>The output of the above code will be a string representing the current date and time in 
                the local format, for example:</p>
        
        <p>&quot;3/15/2023, 2:46:15 PM&quot;</p>
        
        <p>The exact format of the string may vary depending on the user's locale and browser settings.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>Loop methods.<br>
        map() Applies a provided function to each element of the array and returns a new array with 
        the results of those function applications.<br>
        const myArray = [1, 2, 3];<br>
        const newArray = myArray.map(x => x * 2);<br>
        In this example, the map() method is used to transform each element of the myArray array by 
        multiplying it by 2. The resulting array [2, 4, 6] is assigned to the newArray variable. 
        Note that the original array myArray remains unchanged.</p>
        
        <p>filter() Create a new array with all the elements of the original array that pass a certain 
                test. It does not modify the original array, but creates a new array with the elements 
                that meet the specified conditions.<br>
        const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];<br>
        const newArray = myArray.filter(x => x % 2 === 0);<br>
        In this example, the filter() method is used to create a new array newArray with only the even 
        elements of the myArray array. The resulting array [2, 4] is assigned to the newArray variable. Note that the original array myArray remains unchanged.</p>
        
        <p>
        reduce() Iterate over an array and accumulate a single result based on the elements in the array. 
        The reduce() method returns a single value: the function's accumulated result.<br>
        const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];<br>
        const sum = myArray.reduce((accumulated, current) => accumulated + current, 0);<br>
        In this example, the reduce() method is used to compute the sum of the elements in the myArray 
        array by starting with an initial value of 0 for the accumulator accumulated and adding each 
        element current to it. The resulting sum 10 is assigned to the sum variable. The original array 
        myArray remains unchanged.</p>
        
        <p>Functional programming and side effects.<br>
        in computer programming, a &quot;side effect&quot; refers to any observable behavior of a function 
        or method that is not directly related to returning a value. Side effects occur when a function or 
        method changes some state or data outside of its own scope, such as modifying a global variable, 
        writing to a file, or updating a database.<br>
        While side effects may be necessary in some cases, they can also make code harder to reason about, 
        debug, and maintain. For example, a function that modifies a global variable may have unintended 
        consequences if it is used in other parts of the code. Similarly, a function that writes to a file 
        may have unexpected results if the file is being used by other processes at the same time.<br>
        In functional programming, side effects are often avoided as much as possible, in favor of pure 
        functions that have no side effects and always return the same output for a given input. This makes 
        it easier to reason about the behavior of the code and to ensure that it is correct and maintainable.</p>
        
        <p></p>
        
        <p>
        Why a functional approach to loops is to be preferred and how to implement it without side effects.</p>
        
        <p>A functional approach to loops is often preferred because it allows for more readable and maintainable 
                code, with a focus on data transformations rather than the details of how to iterate over that 
                data. In a functional approach, loops are implemented using higher-order functions such as map(), 
                filter(), and reduce() that take a callback function as an argument to perform operations on the 
                data.</p>
        
        <p>This approach avoids side effects by making it clear what the input and output of each operation is, 
                and by not modifying the original data. Side effects can make code harder to understand and debug, 
                especially as the codebase grows larger.</p>
        
        <p>To implement a functional approach without side effects, it's important to always create new arrays 
                or objects rather than modifying the original data. For example, instead of modifying an 
                existing array using push() or splice(), use functions like concat() and slice() to create 
                new arrays with the desired modifications.</p>
        
        <p>It's also important to make sure that the callback functions used in higher-order functions do 
                not modify any external state, but instead rely solely on their input arguments to produce 
                their output. This can be achieved by using pure functions that have no side effects and 
                always return the same output for a given input.</p>
        
        
        <p>
        Redirect.</p>
        
        <p>During the lectures, we have covered two types of re-direct: client-side and server-side.</p>
        
        <p>Here is an example of client-side re-direct :<br>
         if (usernameInput.value === name &amp;&amp; passwordInput.value === password) {<br>
         setTimeout(() => {<br>
         window.location.href = &quot;/frontpage&quot;;<br>
         }, 2500)<br>
         } else {<br>
         alert(&quot;Incorrect username or password!&quot;);<br>
         }<br>
        });</p>
        
        <p>The if statement checks if the log-in credentials are correct. If they are correct, 
                the client is redirected to the html page corresponding with the &ldquo;/frontpage&rdquo; 
                endpoint. The setTimeout() method delays this with 2500ms in this case, and if the login 
                credentials are incorrect, an alert pops up with an error message.</p>
        
        <p>Server-side re-direct :<br>
        res.redirect(&quot;https://www.example.com&quot;);</p>
        
        <p>res.redirect(&quot;back&quot;);</p>
        
        <p>res.redirect(&quot;forward&quot;);</p>
        
        <p>these 3 types of redirect statements can be inserted in a get request handler in the serverside, 
                to resolve if for example a check on login credentials checks out as true.<br>
        app.get(&quot;/api/guards&quot;, (req, res) => {<br>
         if (req.query.passport === &quot;theskyisblue&quot;) {<br>
         return res.redirect(&quot;/api/tanks&quot;); <br>
         }<br>
         res.send({ message: &quot;You are not allowed to see the tanks. Give us the secret in the query 
                string with the key being passport. &quot;}); <br>
        });<br>
        Above is an example of this: This line checks if the passport query parameter in the request URL 
        equals &quot;theskyisblue&quot;. req.query is an object that contains all of the query parameters 
        in the request URL, and req.query.passport is a string containing the value of the passport query 
        parameter. <br>
        If the passport query parameter is &quot;theskyisblue&quot;, this line sends a redirect response 
        to the client, telling it to make a new GET request to the &quot;/api/tanks&quot; route. The return 
        keyword is used here to exit the function early and prevent the rest of the code from being executed.<br>
        If the passport query parameter is not &quot;theskyisblue&quot;, this line sends a JSON response to 
        the client with an error message. The res.send method is used here to send a response with a JSON 
        payload containing a message property. This message tells the client that they are not allowed 
        to see the tanks and asks them to provide the correct secret in the query string with the key 
        &quot;passport&quot;.</p>
