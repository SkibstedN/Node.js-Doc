        <h3>ECMAscript and ES6.</h3>
                <p>ECMAScript (or ES) is a scripting language specification standardized by the Ecma International organization.
                        It was first introduced in 1997 and has been updated several times since then, with the latest version
                        being ES2022.</p>
                <p>ECMAScript provides the core features and functionality for many popular programming languages such as
                        JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript. It defines the syntax, data types, control structures, and
                        objects for these languages, which are used to create dynamic web applications, web pages, and mobile
                        apps.</p>
                <p>The ECMAScript specification defines a set of rules that a language must follow to be considered a conforming
                        implementation of the standard. These rules are designed to ensure that ECMAScript is consistent and
                        compatible across different platforms and environments.</p>
                <p>Some of the key features of ECMAScript include variables, functions, arrays, objects, loops, conditional
                        statements, and error handling. It also includes more advanced features such as classes, modules, arrow
                        functions, generators, and promises.</p>
                <p>JavaScript, which is the most popular client-side scripting language used in web development, is based on the
                        ECMAScript specification. Therefore, developers who work with JavaScript are essentially working with
                        ECMAScript, and are often referred to as ECMAScript developers.</p>

        <h3>ES6.</h3>
                <p>ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, is a major update to the ECMAScript language specification that was
                        released in June 2015. It introduced significant new features and improvements to the language,
                        including:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>Arrow functions</li>
                                <li>Classes</li>
                                <li>Modules</li>
                                <li>Promises</li>
                                <li>Template literals</li>
                                <li>Destructuring</li>
                                <li>Default function parameters</li>
                                <li>Rest and spread operators</li>
                        </ul>
                <p>ES6 was a major update that brought many improvements to JavaScript and made it a more powerful and flexible
                        language. It has been widely adopted by web developers and is supported by all modern browsers. Many
                        developers now use ES6 as the baseline for their JavaScript projects and rely on transpilers like Babel
                        to ensure compatibility with older browsers.</p>

        <h3>Primitive datatypes.</h3>
                <p>Primitive datatypes are not objects and do not have methods. They include:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>Number</li>
                                <li>String</li>
                                <li>Boolean</li>
                                <li>Null</li>
                                <li>Undefined</li>
                                <li>Symbol</li>
                        </ul>

        <h3>Complex datatypes.</h3>
                <p>These are objects that can hold multiple values and have methods. They include:</p>
                        <ul>
                                <li>Object</li>
                                <li>Array</li>
                                <li>Function</li>
                                <li>Date</li>
                                <li>RegEx</li>
                        </ul>
                <p>In addition to these are two special values: NaN (not a number) and Infinity.</p>

        <h3>Scoping: var, let, const â€“ types of variables.</h3>
                <p><code>var</code> is still supported but <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are recommended.</p>
                <p><code>const</code> must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be reassigned once initialized.
                </p>
                <p><code>let</code> is accessible only within the block it is declared, including nested blocks - it can be
                        reassigned but cannot be redecorated within the same scope.</p>
        
        <h3>Strings.</h3>
                <p><code>number()</code> converts a string, boolean, or object value to a number.</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>const myString = "123";
                        const myNumber = Number(myString);</code>
                </pre>
                <p>In this example, the <code>Number()</code> method is used to convert the string "123" to a number. The
                        resulting number is assigned to the <code>myNumber</code> variable.</p>
                <p><code>parseFloat()</code> converts float values in a string to a floating-point number that can be logged.
                </p>
                <pre>
                        <code>const myString = "3.14";
                        const myNumber = parseFloat(myString);</code>
                </pre>
                <p>In this example, the <code>parseFloat()</code> method is used to convert the string "3.14" to a
                        floating-point number. The resulting number is assigned to the <code>myNumber</code> variable.</p>
                <p><code>toFixed()</code> - format a number as a string with a specified number of decimal places.</p>
                <p>The result of the function is always a string, not a number. If you need to perform arithmetic operations on
                        the result, you will need to convert the string back to a number using the <code>Number()</code>
                        function or <code>parseFloat()</code> method.</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>const myNumber = 3.14159;
                        const formattedNumber = myNumber.toFixed(2);
                </code>
                </pre>
                <p>In this example, the <code>toFixed()</code> method is used to format the number 3.14159 with 2 decimal
                        places. The resulting string "3.14" is assigned to the <code>formattedNumber</code> variable.</p>
                <p><code>Replace()</code> - search a string for a specified value or a regular expression, and replace the
                        matching values with a new value.</p>
                        <pre>
                        <code>const myString = "Hello, world!";
                        const newString = myString.replace("world", "JavaScript");
                                </code></pre>        
                <p>In this example, the <code>replace()</code> method is used to replace the substring "world" in the string
                        "Hello, world!" with "JavaScript". The resulting string "Hello, JavaScript!" is assigned to the
                        <code>newString</code> variable.
                </p>

        <h3>Arrays.</h3>
                <p><code>push()</code> adds elements to the end of an array.</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
                        myArray.push(4);</code>
                </pre>
                <p>In this example, the <code>push()</code> method is used to add the element 4 to the end of the
                        <code>myArray</code> array. The resulting array <code>[1, 2, 3, 4]</code> is assigned back to
                        <code>myArray</code>.
                </p>
                <p><code>indexOf()</code> searches an array for an element and returns its index position. If the element is not
                        found in the array, the method returns -1.</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>const myArray = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
                        const index = myArray.indexOf("banana");</code>
                </pre>
                <p>In this example, the <code>indexOf()</code> method is used to find the index of the "banana" element in the
                        <code>myArray</code> array. The resulting index <code>1</code> is assigned to the <code>index</code>
                        variable.
                </p>
                <p><code>splice()</code> adds and/or removes elements from an array.</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
                        myArray.splice(1, 2, "a", "b");</code>
                </pre>
                <p>In this example, the <code>splice()</code> method is used to remove two elements starting from the index 1 in
                        the <code>myArray</code> array, and then add two new elements "a" and "b" at the same position. The
                        resulting array <code>[1, "a", "b", 4]</code> is assigned back to <code>myArray</code>.</p>
                <p><code>slice()</code> copies an array or elements of an array into a new array.</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
                        const newArray = myArray.slice(1, 3);</code>
                </pre>
                <p>In this example, the <code>slice()</code> method is used to extract elements starting from index 1 up to, but
                        not including, index 3 in the <code>myArray</code> array. The resulting array <code>[2, 3]</code> is
                        assigned to the <code>newArray</code> variable. Note that the original array <code>myArray</code>
                        remains unchanged.</p>
                <p><code>pop()</code> removes the last element from an array and returns that element.</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
                        const lastElement = myArray.pop();</code>
                </pre>
                <p>In this example, the <code>pop()</code> method is used to remove the last element (<code>4</code>) from the
                        <code>myArray</code> array and return it. The resulting array <code>[1, 2, 3]</code> is assigned back to
                        <code>myArray</code>, and the returned element <code>4</code> is assigned to the
                        <code>lastElement</code>variable
                </p>

        <h3>Callback functions.</h3>
                <p>Callbacks are used to handle the results of asynchronous operations in a non-blocking manner. The callback
                function is passed as an argument to another function and is called by that function at some point
                during its execution.</p>

        <h3>Date() object.</h3>
                <p>In JavaScript, the Date object is a built-in object that represents a single moment in time. It can be used
                        to work with dates and times in various ways, such as creating, formatting, and manipulating dates.</p>
                <p>When you create a Date object using the <code>new Date()</code> constructor, it will be initialized with the
                        current date and time. You can also create a Date object for a specific date and time by passing
                        arguments to the constructor.</p>
                <p>Here are some common methods and properties of the Date object:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li><code>getFullYear()</code> - returns the year of the date as a four-digit number</li>
                        <li><code>getMonth()</code> - returns the month of the date as a zero-based number (0 = January, 1 =
                                February, etc.)</li>
                        <li><code>getDate()</code> - returns the day of the month of the date as a number (1-31)</li>
                        <li><code>getDay()</code> - returns the day of the week of the date as a zero-based number (0 = Sunday,
                                1 = Monday, etc.)</li>
                        <li><code>getHours()</code> - returns the hour of the date as a number (0-23)</li>
                        <li><code>getMinutes()</code> - returns the minute of the date as a number (0-59)</li>
                        <li><code>getSeconds()</code> - returns the second of the date as a number (0-59)</li>
                        <li><code>getTime()</code> - returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC
                                (also known as Unix timestamp)</li>
                        <li><code>setFullYear()</code> - sets the year of the date</li>
                        <li><code>setMonth()</code> - sets the month of the date (zero-based)</li>
                        <li><code>setDate()</code> - sets the day of the month of the date</li>
                        <li><code>setHours()</code> - sets the hour of the date</li>
                        <li><code>setMinutes()</code> - sets the minute of the date</li>
                        <li><code>setSeconds()</code> - sets the second of the date</li>
                        <li><code>toString()</code> - returns a string representing the date and time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There are many other methods and properties available on the Date object, and it is a powerful tool for
                        working with dates and times in JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Here's an example of creating a new Date object and getting the current date and time:</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>const currentDate = new Date().toLocaleString();
                        </code></pre>
                <p>The output of the above code will be a string representing the current date and time in the local format, for
                        example:</p>
                <p>"3/15/2023, 2:46:15 PM"</p>
                <p>The exact format of the string may vary depending on the user's locale and browser settings.</p>

        <h3>setTimeout()</h3>        
                <p><code>setTimeout()</code> is a JavaScript function that allows you to schedule the execution of a function after a 
                        specified amount of time. When you call <code>setTimeout()</code>, you provide it with a function to execute 
                        and a delay time (in milliseconds) before the function should execute. The function is only executed once, 
                        after the specified delay time has elapsed. You can also pass optional arguments to the function.</p>

                <p>Here is an example usage of <code>setTimeout()</code>:</p>
                        <pre>
                                <code>setTimeout(function() {
                                        console.log('This function was executed after a 3-second delay.');
                                        }, 3000);</code></pre>
                
                <p>If you need to cancel the execution of the function, you can use the <code>clearTimeout()</code> function, 
                        passing in the timer ID returned by <code>setTimeout()</code>. This can be useful if you change your mind about 
                        executing the function, or if you want to prevent the function from being executed multiple times.</p>
                <p>Overall, <code>setTimeout()</code> is a useful function for scheduling a function to be executed after a delay, 
                        allowing you to control the timing of certain events in your JavaScript code.</p>      

        <h3>Client-side and Server-side Redirection in JavaScript</h3>
                <p>Redirection refers to the process of forwarding a user from one web page to another web page. There are two 
                        types of redirection: client-side and server-side.</p>
        <h4>Client-side redirection:</h4>
                <p>Client-side redirection can be achieved using the window.location object in JavaScript. For example, 
                        to redirect the user to a new page, you can set the window.location.href property to the URL of the new page:</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>window.location.href = "http://example.com";</code></pre>

                <p>You can also use window.location.replace() method to redirect to a new page:</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>window.location.replace("http://example.com");</code></pre>

        <h4>Server-side redirection:</h4>
                <p>Server-side redirection can be achieved using server-side JavaScript frameworks like Node.js. For example, 
                        using the Express.js framework, you can use the res.redirect() method to redirect the user to a new page:</p>
                        <pre>
                        <code>app.get('/redirect', function(req, res){
                        res.redirect('http://example.com');
                                });</code></pre>
                <p>You can also use the res.writeHead() method to send a response header with a new location to redirect to:</p>
                        <pre>
                        <code>res.writeHead(302, {
                           'Location': 'http://example.com'
                        });
                        res.end();</code></pre>       
                <p>In both cases, the server sends a response to the client with a new location to redirect to.</p>        

        <h3>Loop methods.</h3>
                <p><code>map()</code> Applies a provided function to each element of the array and returns a new array with the
                        results of those function applications.</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>const myArray = [1, 2, 3];
                        const newArray = myArray.map(x => x * 2);
                        </code></pre>
                <p>In this example, the <code>map()</code> method is used to transform each element of the <code>myArray</code>
                        array by multiplying it by 2. The resulting array <code>[2, 4, 6]</code> is assigned to the
                        <code>newArray</code> variable. Note that the original array <code>myArray</code> remains unchanged.</p>
                <p><code>filter()</code> Create a new array with all the elements of the original array that pass a certain
                        test. It does not modify the original array, but creates a new array with the elements that meet the
                        specified conditions.</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
                        const newArray = myArray.filter(x => x % 2 === 0);
                        </code></pre>
                <p>In this example, the <code>filter()</code> method is used to create a new array <code>newArray</code> with
                        only the even elements of the <code>myArray</code> array. The resulting array <code>[2, 4]</code> is
                        assigned to the <code>newArray</code> variable. Note that the original array <code>myArray</code>
                        remains unchanged.</p>
                <p><code>reduce()</code> Iterate over an array and accumulate a single result based on the elements in the
                        array. The <code>reduce()</code> method returns a single value: the function's accumulated result.</p>
                <pre>
                        <code>const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
                        const sum = myArray.reduce((accumulated, current) => accumulated + current, 0);
                        </code></pre>
                <p>In this example, the <code>reduce()</code> method is used to compute the sum of the elements in the
                        <code>myArray</code> array by starting with an initial value of 0 for the accumulator
                        <code>accumulated</code> and adding each element <code>current</code> to it. The resulting sum
                        <code>10</code> is assigned to the <code>sum</code> variable. The original array <code>myArray</code>
                        remains unchanged.</p>

        <h3>Why a functional approach to loops is to be preferred and how to implement it without side effects. </h3>
                <p>A functional approach to loops is often preferred because it allows for more readable and maintainable code,
                        with a focus on data transformations rather than the details of how to iterate over that data. In a
                        functional approach, loops are implemented using higher-order functions such as <code>map()</code>,
                        <code>filter()</code>, and <code>reduce()</code> that take a callback function as an argument to perform
                        operations on the data.</p>
                
                <p>This approach avoids side effects by making it clear what the input and output of each operation is, and by
                        not modifying the original data. Side effects can make code harder to understand and debug, especially
                        as the codebase grows larger.</p>

                <p>To implement a functional approach without side effects, it's important to always create new arrays or
                        objects rather than modifying the original data. For example, instead of modifying an existing array
                        using <code>push()</code> or <code>splice()</code>, use functions like <code>concat()</code> and
                        <code>slice()</code> to create new arrays with the desired modifications.</p>
                
                <p>It's also important to make sure that the callback functions used in higher-order functions do not modify any
                        external state, but instead rely solely on their input arguments to produce their output. This can be
                        achieved by using pure functions that have no side effects and always return the same output for a given
                        input.</p>
