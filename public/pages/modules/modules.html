    <h1>Modules in JavaScript and Node.js</h1>
    <p><b>JavaScript modules</b> and <b>Node.js modules</b> are two types of modular programming 
        paradigms in JavaScript.<br><br>

        <b>JavaScript modules</b> are a way to organize code into reusable pieces of code, 
        making it easier to maintain and reuse. A module is essentially a JavaScript 
        file containing variables, functions, or objects that can be imported and used 
        in other parts of the code. JavaScript modules were introduced in ES6 and are 
        supported in modern web browsers.<br></p>
        
    <p> <b>Node.js modules</b> are similar to JavaScript modules, but they are specifically 
        designed for use in the Node.js environment. Node.js modules use the CommonJS 
        module format, which allows for exporting and importing modules using the 
        require function. Node.js modules can be installed and managed using the 
        Node Package Manager (npm).<br></p>
        
    <p> The main difference between JavaScript modules and Node.js modules is the way 
        they are loaded and executed. JavaScript modules are loaded asynchronously, 
        meaning they are only loaded when they are needed, while Node.js modules are 
        loaded synchronously at runtime. Additionally, JavaScript modules are loaded 
        directly from the browser, while Node.js modules are typically loaded from the 
        local file system or from an external package repository.</p><br>
        
    <b>JavaScript module example:</b>
        <pre>
            <code>
        // math.js
        export function add(a, b) {
          return a + b;
        }
        
        export function subtract(a, b) {
          return a - b;
        }
        
        
        // main.js
        import { add, subtract } from './math.js';
        
        console.log(add(1, 2));
        console.log(subtract(4, 3));
            </code>
        </pre>
        
    <p>In this example, math.js is a JavaScript module that exports two functions add 
        and subtract. These functions can be imported and used in other parts of the code,
         as shown in main.js.</p><br>
        
        
    <b> Node.js module example: </b>
        <pre>
            <code>
        // math.js
        exports.add = function(a, b) {
          return a + b;
        };
        
        exports.subtract = function(a, b) {
          return a - b;
        };
        
        // main.js
        const math = require('./math.js');
        
        console.log(math.add(1, 2));
        console.log(math.subtract(4, 3));
            </code>
        </pre>
        
    <p> In this example, math.js is a Node.js module that exports two functions add and subtract 
        using the exports object. These functions can be imported and used in other parts of the 
        code using the require function, as shown in main.js.</p>
        
    <p> Overall, both JavaScript and Node.js modules allow for more modular, maintainable, 
        and reusable code in JavaScript. The choice of which type of module to use depends 
        on the specific requirements and environment of the current project.</p>
        
    <p> <b>Require vs import/export.</b>
        Require and import/export are two different ways of importing and exporting modules in JavaScript.
        require is a built-in function in Node.js that is used to load modules. It takes a string argument 
        that specifies the path to the module file and returns the module's exports object. </p>
        
    <p> On the other hand, import/export is a newer syntax introduced in ES6 that allows you to import and
        export modules in JavaScript. import is used to load modules, and export is used to export values 
        from a module.</p>
        
    <p> The main differences between require and import/export are:<br><br>
        
        require is a built-in function in Node.js, while import/export is a language feature introduced 
        in ES6 that is supported in modern web browsers.<br><br>
        
        require is a synchronous operation that loads modules at runtime, while import/export is an 
        asynchronous operation that loads modules at compile time.<br><br>
        
        require loads the entire module and returns its exports object, while import/export allows you to 
        selectively import and export specific values from a module.</p>
        
    <p> <b>CommonJS</b> is a module specification for JavaScript that defines a standard way of organizing 
        code into reusable modules. It was initially designed for use in server-side JavaScript environments, 
        such as Node.js, but it can also be used in web browsers with the help of bundlers like Webpack and 
        Browserify.<br><br>
        
        The CommonJS specification provides a set of rules for defining and requiring modules. A module in 
        CommonJS is a self-contained unit of code that can be used in other modules or scripts. Each module 
        has its own scope, so variables and functions defined in one module are not accessible from other
        modules unless explicitly exported.<br><br>
        
        CommonJS modules are typically organized as individual files, with each file containing a single 
        module. Modules can be imported and exported using the require and module.exports statements, 
        respectively. The require statement is used to load a module, and the module.exports statement is 
        used to define what the module exports to other modules that require it.<br><br>
        
        Overall, CommonJS provides a way to write modular and reusable code in JavaScript, making it easier 
        to manage large codebases and collaborate on projects with multiple developers.
