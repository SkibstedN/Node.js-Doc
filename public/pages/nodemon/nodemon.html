                <h1>Nodemon.</h1>
                Nodemon is a tool that helps developers to automatically restart a Node.js application whenever there is a change in the source code. It is particularly useful during the development process when developers need to make frequent changes to the code and want to see the results without manually restarting the application every time.
                With nodemon, developers can start their Node.js application using the nodemon command instead of the node command. Nodemon will then monitor the project directory for changes to any files, and automatically restart the application whenever a change is detected.
                Nodemon provides several options to customize its behavior, such as specifying the directory to watch, ignoring specific files or directories, setting a delay before restarting the application, and more. These options can be specified on the command line or in a nodemon configuration file.
                To install nodemon, use the npm package manager by running the following command:
                <pre><code>     npm install -g nodemon</code></pre>
                Once installed, start the Node.js application using `nodemon` instead of `node`  :
                <pre><code>     nodemon app.js</code></pre>
        </p>
