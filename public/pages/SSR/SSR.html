    <h2>Server-side rendering.</h2>
    <p>To describe server-side rendering  (SSR) we also have to take a look at client-side rendering (CSR) to compare the two 
        and know the differences.</p>
    <p>Client-side rendering and server-side rendering are two different approaches to generating HTML
        content for web applications.</p>
    <p>Client-side rendering is a method where the HTML is generated by JavaScript running on the user's device
        (browser), after receiving the data from the server. In other words, the server sends the data, and the client
        (browser) processes and generates the HTML. This approach is commonly used in single-page applications (SPAs)
        and can provide a faster and more responsive user experience. However, it can also result in slower initial
        loading times and decreased search engine optimization (SEO) due to the lack of pre-rendered HTML.</p>
    <p>Server-side rendering, on the other hand, is a method where the HTML is generated on the server before sending it
        to the client. In this approach, the server sends fully rendered HTML to the client, reducing the load on the
        client's device. This approach is commonly used in traditional server-rendered web applications and can provide
        better SEO and faster initial loading times. However, it may result in a less responsive user experience and
        require more server resources.</p>
    <p>Choosing the appropriate rendering method depends on the specific needs of your project. Client-side rendering
        may be a better choice if your application is a SPA or has a lot of dynamic content, where real-time updates are
        needed. Server-side rendering may be a better choice if your application needs to have better SEO and faster
        initial loading times, especially for content-heavy websites. In some cases, a hybrid approach may be used,
        where initial rendering is done on the server and then additional updates are done on the client-side using
        JavaScript.</p>
