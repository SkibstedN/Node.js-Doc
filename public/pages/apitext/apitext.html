    <h2>Designing a REST API</h2>
    <p>Designing a REST API involves several steps that are critical to ensure that the API is functional, secure, and
        scalable. Below is a high-level description of the process:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Define the Use Cases:</strong> The first step in designing a REST API is to identify the use cases
            it will serve. This will help you determine the resources and endpoints that the API needs to expose.</li>
        <li><strong>Identify Resources:</strong> Once the use cases have been defined, the next step is to identify the
            resources that the API will expose. A resource is a representation of an object or concept in the system,
            such as a user, order, or product.</li>
        <li><strong>Define Endpoints:</strong> Once you have identified the resources, the next step is to define the
            endpoints that will be used to interact with them. Each endpoint should be based on a specific HTTP method
            (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and should correspond to a specific operation on the resource.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose Response Formats:</strong> The next step is to choose the response formats that the API will
            support. Common formats include JSON and XML.</li>
        <li><strong>Define Error Handling:</strong> It is important to define how the API will handle errors. This
            includes defining error codes and messages, as well as specifying the format of error responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Authentication and Authorization:</strong> REST APIs should be secured through
            authentication and authorization mechanisms. You should define how users will authenticate and how
            authorization will be implemented.</li>
        <li><strong>Consider Caching:</strong> Caching can help improve the performance of the API by reducing the
            number of requests made to the server. You should consider whether to implement caching and what caching
            strategies to use.</li>
        <li><strong>Document the API:</strong> It is important to provide documentation for the API, including details
            on how to access resources and endpoints, what parameters are required, and what responses to expect.</li>
        <li><strong>Test and Iterate:</strong> Once the API has been designed, it is important to test it thoroughly and
            iterate as necessary to ensure that it meets the requirements of the use cases and is functional, secure,
            and scalable.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>By following these steps, you can design a REST API that is well-structured, easy to use, and secure.</p>
