<div class="textbox"><h1>Git</h1>
        <p>Git is a version control system for tracking changes in software code, text files, and other content. 
            It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 as a tool to manage the development of the Linux operating 
            system, but it has since become a popular tool for software developers to collaborate and manage 
            changes to their code.</p>
        <p>Git works by storing a complete history of the changes made to a project's files over time, allowing 
            developers to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate on code changes with other
            team members.</p>
        <p>Git uses a distributed model, which means that each developer has a local copy of the code repository, 
            and changes can be synchronized with other team members through a central repository or directly 
            between developers.</p>
        <p>Some of the key features of Git include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Branching and merging: Developers can create new branches to experiment with changes without 
                affecting the main codebase, and merge those changes back into the main branch when ready.</li>
            <li>Distributed model: Each developer has a complete copy of the code repository, which allows them 
                to work offline and collaborate with other developers without being connected to a central 
                server.</li>
            <li>Staging area: Changes to files can be staged before being committed, allowing developers to 
                review and selectively include changes in their commits.</li>
            <li>Version tracking: Git stores a complete history of changes made to a project, allowing 
                developers to track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Git is widely used in the software development industry, and many popular online platforms 
            like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide hosting and collaboration tools for Git repositories.</p>
        <p>We use these three commands all the time to commit and push changes to our Git repository.</p>
        
        <p>     <pre><code>   git add -A</code></pre>      Stages all changes in the working directory.</p>
        <p>     <pre><code>   git commit -m</code></pre>   Creates a new commit with a message describing the changes.</p>
        <p>     <pre><code>   git push</code></pre>        Uploads the changes to the remote repository.</p>
